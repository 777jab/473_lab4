# 8-bit Microcontroller Alarm Clock
### Josh Barksdale
* This project uses an ATMEGA 128 microcontroller to make an alarm clock.
* hd4470.c and hd4470.h are library files for controlling an LCD display.
* The schematics folder contains pictures of hand-drawn schematics for 
the project.
* The Makefile manages compilation and flashing of the program.
* main.c is the main microcontroller code
